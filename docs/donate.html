				<h1 class="title">Support Pro for Trello development</h1>
				<p class="subtitle">
					<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>
					Thank you for considering a donation to the author of Pro for Trello
				</p>
			</section>

			<h2>Why should you donate?</h2>
			<p>
				Pro for Trello is a <strong>free</strong> Google Chrome extension. It will always be free.
				Whether you donate or not will not change that. But it sure as hell could
				<strong>make a difference</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're supercharging Trello on a daily basis with Pro for Trello you should consider making
				a symbolic donation since it's making your life easier. If you're using it for work and
				making money with the help of Pro for Trello features you should consider supporting further development.
			</p>

			<h2>What amount is appropriate?</h2>
			<p>
				Authors of free software often use <strong>paid tools</strong> and generally pay for a number
				of licenses on a monthly basis. Donating some money to their cause will simply motivate them
				to maintain, support and improve their free software, since even the smallest donation makes
				them feel like their work is being appreciated.
			</p>
			<p>
				With that being said (or written, right?) anything <strong>from 10 to 50 EUR/USD</strong> will make a contribution.
				That doesn't mean the author would refuse a more considerable donation <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
			</p>

			<h2>Do you get something?</h2>
			<p>
				Of course! You get an honest "thank you" in the form of a personalized email message (if you provide your email) and
				a public "thanks" in Pro for Trello's <strong>About</strong> section and on author's personal website.
			</p>
			<p>
				And that's not all! You get that special feeling of <strong>doing the right thing</strong>,
				just like when you do something good. It's an awesome feeling.
			</p>

			<h2>How to donate?</h2>
			<p>
				If you have a PayPal account, you can make a direct transfer to the author's PayPal account
				<a id="paypal-button-donate" class="tpro-analytics" href="https://www.paypal.me/mdjekic" target="_blank">here</a>.
